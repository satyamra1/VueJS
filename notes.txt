What is the difference between React and Vue?

Installation- There are 2 ways to Use Vue.js
1.CDN
2.CLI

There are two things in the folder- one is for html other is for JS 
in .vue extention files their should be 3 block of codes -
1. Template(For html)
2. Script(for JS)
3. Style(For CSS)

Main.js - It is used to mount components with html (ex- createApp.mount('#app); )


Interpolation and Data
Interpolation is the way to compile javascript into the html Template. It is done by using - {{ }}
Or using Interpolation you can use send the data from script to Template

<template>
    <h1>Email: {{ email }}</h1>
    <h1>Email: {{ mobile }}</h1>
    <h1>Email: {{ mobile=8888 }}</h1>

</template>

<script>

export default {
    data() {
        return {
            email: "satyam@gmail.com",
            mobile: 9999 
        }
    }
}

</script>

<style>
h1{
    color: red;
}

</style>

Methods in Vue: We create functions or object inside it, which is used to send data into html template.

Code example- 

Events- We can create events in Vue, like -

<template>
<button  v-on:click="alertBtn()">  </button>
<template>

<script>
export default {
    name:"home",
    methods:{
        alertBtn(){
            alert("Button clicked")
        }
    }
}
<script>
